>a diary web application build with AngularJS and Bootstrap

QDiary is a lightweight diary web application build with AngularJS and Bootstrap.

`Bootstrap` for UI design, `AngularJS` acts as the backbone of the whole application. And it's data stores on `localStorage`.

The localStorage API was encapsulated as an AngularJS `service` in the application, which was created as a independent repository : [simple-storage](https://github.com/cynil/simple-storage), since I found it may be useful in other situation.

Enjoy your time with writing diaries.
